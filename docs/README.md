# SQUADZ Docs

## What is Squadz?
Squadz is a protocol for managing *composable communities*: social groups made interoperable by representing them on blockchains. It works by issuing members pseudo-temporary, non-transferable NFTs.

It is deployed on multiple chains including Goerli, Rinkeby, Polygon, and Polygon Mumbai.

## Why should I care?
### Composability
It's easy to integrate your squad with other software tools: use [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/) for community voting, create a members-only discord server with [Guild](https://guild.xyz/), and so on. 

This is true because Squadz is built on public blockchains, which act as permanently public APIs with large ecosystems of open source tools for building on and integrating with them.

### Values-oriented communities
Squads are NFT collections where holders are defined by who your community invites, instead of by who buys a membership. The Squadz-approach is better for communities that put values other than money first.

### General-purpose, non-transferable voting power
Much has been written on the [faults](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html) of [transferable voting power](https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/03/28/plutocracy.html) in [DAOs](https://daohaus.substack.com/p/tokens-and-goodharts-forest). Squadz provides this function flexibly:
- a DAO (or any other Ethereum contract) can own a Squad
- Squadz is highly configurable
- Squadz is unopinionated about why tokens are being minted
